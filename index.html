                    <h1>Intel Best Buy</h1>
                    <p>We teamed up with Intel and Best Buy to create an engaging experience in Best Buy stores across
                        the US. I was in charge of developing the content for the two 9 foot tall totems that welcomed
                        the users into the experience. On the totem there was an intel robot that the user could control
                        by moving thier body around, as well as trigger animations by discovering certain poses. The
                        experience was built with the Xbox Kinect and Unity 3d. <a href="https://vimeo.com/127383801"

                    <h1>Kraft Macaroni - Interactive floor</h1>
                    <p>Working with the team at Next Now Interactive I helped develop the Kraft Macaroni Interactive Floor experience. The project was deployed in Supermarkets across the US where users could interact with the Kraft brand. The experience was developed in Unity 3d using C# and the Kinect. My primary contribution to this project was setting up openCV, a computer vision library, to track when people and objects were in view. I also was in charge of the hardware and setting up the experience on location. </p>
